# Linked Lists

In this assignment you'll implement a _Linked List_ data structure. 

A linked list is a fundamental data structure and can be used to implement other common data structures.  It represents a linear collection of data items whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.  While an array keeps a linear set of items in order in contiguous memory order, a _Linked List_ has each item in the list _point_ to the next. The _Linked List_ is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes (objects) which together represent a sequence.

We've covered the data elements (_struct_) and the associated operations needed for a _Linked List_ in the video lectures.

Refer to materials from class on how to proceed from here.

## Objectives

* Use pointers to manage an ordered set of data objects
* Manually allocate and reclaim memory used by those pointers
* Understand the complexity of inserting, deleting, and traversing a Linked List
